You are sleeping badly, either too much or not enough, and things that used to feel easy, like texting a friend back or making plans, now feel like effort you do not have. Nothing dramatic has happened. That almost makes it harder to explain. You have found yourself wondering whether you are just tired, or whether something is actually wrong. You have not said any of this to anyone. Tonight, almost without thinking about it, you open an AI chat app. You are not sure what you want to say. You just want somewhere to put it.`,

Feeling like you say something and they hear something else entirely. Last week there was a fight that left you both quiet for days, and you still do not feel like it resolved anything. You have been carrying a tight, unsettled feeling since then, replaying things, second-guessing yourself. You do not really want to vent to friends about your relationship. It feels disloyal, and you are not sure what you would even want them to say. So tonight you open an AI chat app, hoping it will help to just say it out loud somewhere.`,

You and this person had been close for years, and losing the friendship has left a gap you did not expect to feel so strongly. You find yourself thinking about it often, feeling a mix of sadness and confusion. It does not feel easy to bring up with people in your life because it does not seem like the kind of loss others take seriously. One evening you open an AI chat app. You are not looking for advice. You just want to talk to something that will not tell you to get over it.`,

Once you have read it, you will have a conversation with an AI. Please respond as you naturally would if you were actually in this situation. There are no right or wrong things to say.

After the conversation ends, you will be asked some questions about your experience. Please answer based on how you genuinely felt during the interaction, not how you think you were supposed to feel.`;
